                <div class="info-box">
                    <p><strong>Inductive reasoning</strong> is the opposite direction of deductive reasoning. You start from <em>specific observations</em> and work <em>up</em> to a <strong>general conclusion</strong>.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>⬆️ Specific observations → General rule</li>
                        <li>⬆️ Pattern → Conjecture (educated guess)</li>
                        <li>⬆️ Used constantly in science, medicine, and everyday life</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Important:</strong> Unlike deductive conclusions, inductive conclusions are <em>probable</em> but never <em>certain</em>. Even a very strong inductive argument can be wrong.</p>

                <h2>🔢 Patterns and Conjectures</h2>
                <p>A <strong>conjecture</strong> is a conclusion reached through inductive reasoning — an educated guess based on patterns. Conjectures can later be <em>proven</em> or <em>disproven</em>.</p>

                <p>A <strong>counterexample</strong> is a single example that proves a conjecture is <strong>false</strong>. You only need <em>one</em> counterexample to disprove a universal statement ("all," "every," "never").</p>
