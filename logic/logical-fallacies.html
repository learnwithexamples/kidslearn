                <h2>🎭 What Is a Logical Fallacy?</h2>
                <div class="info-box">
                    <p>A <strong>logical fallacy</strong> is an error in reasoning that makes an argument invalid or misleading — even when it <em>sounds</em> convincing at first.</p>
                    <p>Fallacies come in two broad types:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Formal fallacies</strong> — errors in the logical <em>structure</em> of the argument (e.g., invalid syllogisms).</li>
                        <li><strong>Informal fallacies</strong> — errors in the <em>content</em> or <em>context</em> — what the argument is about, not just its form.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Recognizing fallacies helps you think more clearly, argue better, and avoid being deceived.</p>
