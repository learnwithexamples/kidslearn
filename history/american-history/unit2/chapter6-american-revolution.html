                <h3>The Second Continental Congress</h3>
                <p>After Lexington and Concord, the <strong>Second Continental Congress</strong> met in Philadelphia (May 1775). They had important decisions to make:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Created the <strong>Continental Army</strong> to fight Britain</li>
                    <li>Chose <strong>George Washington</strong> as commander-in-chief</li>
                    <li>Sent the "Olive Branch Petition" to King George III, seeking peace (he rejected it)</li>
                    <li>Eventually decided to declare independence from Britain</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="key-figure">
                    <h4>Thomas Jefferson (1743-1826)</h4>
                    <p>Virginia delegate chosen to write the Declaration of Independence. At 33, he was one of the youngest delegates. Later became the 3rd President of the United States.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Writing the Declaration</h3>
                <p>Jefferson worked for 17 days writing the document. He was influenced by Enlightenment thinkers like John Locke. The Declaration has three main parts:</p>

                    <h4>🔑 Key Ideas in the Declaration</h4>
                    <p><strong>1. Natural Rights</strong></p>
                    <p>"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness."</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>2. Social Contract</strong></p>
                    <p>Governments get their power from "the consent of the governed." If a government violates people's rights, the people have the right to change or abolish it.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>3. List of Grievances</strong></p>
                    <p>27 complaints against King George III, explaining why the colonies must break away</p>

                    <li>Help from France (later in the war)</li>
                    <li>Only needed to survive; Britain had to conquer and control</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>American Disadvantages:</strong></p>
                <ul>

                    <li>Little money for supplies</li>

                <div class="key-figure">
                    <h4>George Washington (1732-1799)</h4>
                    <p>Commander of the Continental Army. Not a brilliant military strategist, but an inspirational leader who kept the army together through terrible hardships. His greatest achievement was keeping the revolution alive when it seemed hopeless.</p>

                <h2>❄️ Early Battles and Struggles</h2>

                <h3>The Siege of Boston (1775-1776)</h3>
                <p>After Bunker Hill, Washington's army surrounded Boston. Henry Knox brought cannons from Fort Ticonderoga (dragging them 300 miles through winter!). Facing the cannons, the British evacuated Boston in March 1776.</p>

                <h3>The Disaster in New York (1776)</h3>
                <p>Britain sent a huge force to capture New York City. Washington's army was badly defeated and forced to retreat across New Jersey. The revolution seemed close to failure.</p>

                <div class="historical-note">
                    <h4>📖 Thomas Paine's "Common Sense"</h4>
                    <p>In January 1776, Thomas Paine published a pamphlet arguing for independence. Written in plain language anyone could understand, it became a bestseller and convinced many colonists to support independence.</p>
                    <p>Later, during the dark days of 1776, Paine wrote "The Crisis": "These are the times that try men's souls..." His words inspired the army to keep fighting.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Washington Crosses the Delaware (December 25-26, 1776)</h3>
                <p>In a daring move, Washington crossed the icy Delaware River on Christmas night and attacked Hessian troops (German soldiers hired by Britain) at Trenton, New Jersey.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Achieved complete surprise</li>
                    <li>Captured about 1,000 Hessians</li>
                    <li>Boosted American morale when spirits were lowest</li>
                    <li>Proved the Continental Army could win battles</li>

                <h2>🎯 The Turning Point: Saratoga (1777)</h2>

                <h3>Britain's Plan</h3>
                <p>British General Burgoyne planned to march south from Canada to Albany, New York, cutting off New England from the other colonies. But his army got lost in the wilderness and ran low on supplies.</p>

                <h3>The Battles of Saratoga (September-October 1777)</h3>
                <p>American forces surrounded Burgoyne near Saratoga, New York. After two battles, Burgoyne surrendered his entire army of about 6,000 soldiers!</p>

                    <h4>⭐ Why Saratoga Was So Important</h4>
                    <p>The American victory at Saratoga was the <strong>turning point of the war</strong> because it convinced France to officially join the war as America's ally!</p>
                    <p><strong>Benjamin Franklin</strong> had been in Paris seeking French help. After Saratoga proved Americans could win, France agreed to an alliance (February 1778).</p>

                <h3>Help from France</h3>
                <p>French assistance was crucial to American victory:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Money and supplies</strong> - France provided desperately needed funding</li>
                    <li><strong>French navy</strong> - Challenged British control of the seas</li>
                    <li><strong>French troops</strong> - Professional soldiers helped the Continental Army</li>
                    <li><strong>Marquis de Lafayette</strong> - Young French nobleman who became Washington's trusted aide</li>

                <p>While British soldiers stayed warm in Philadelphia, Washington's army spent a brutal winter at Valley Forge, Pennsylvania.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Inadequate food - soldiers often went days without eating</li>
