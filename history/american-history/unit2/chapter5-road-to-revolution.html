                <h2>👑 British Control and Colonial Frustration</h2>
                
                <h3>After the French and Indian War (1763)</h3>
                <p>Britain defeated France in the <strong>French and Indian War</strong> (1754-1763), gaining control of much of North America. But the war was very expensive!</p>

                <div class="historical-note">
                    <h4>💰 Britain's Problem</h4>
                    <p>The war left Britain with a huge debt. King George III and Parliament believed the colonies should help pay for their own defense. The colonists disagreed - this was the beginning of major conflict.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Proclamation of 1763</h3>
                <p>Britain banned colonists from settling west of the Appalachian Mountains. This was meant to avoid conflicts with Native Americans, but colonists were angry because:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>They wanted to expand westward</li>
                    <li>They had fought in the war partly for western lands</li>
                    <li>Many ignored the proclamation anyway</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>💸 "No Taxation Without Representation!"</h2>

                <h3>New British Taxes</h3>
                <p>Britain passed several tax laws to raise money from the colonies:</p>

                </div>

                <h3>Colonial Protests</h3>
                <p>Colonists were furious! They argued:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>"<strong>No taxation without representation!</strong>" - Parliament taxed them, but colonists had no representatives in Parliament</li>
                    <li>Only colonial assemblies should tax colonists</li>
                    <li>These were violations of their rights as English citizens</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="key-figure">
                    <h4>Samuel Adams (1722-1803)</h4>
                    <p>Boston leader and organizer of colonial protests. Founded the <strong>Sons of Liberty</strong>, a group that protested British policies. Cousin of future president John Adams.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Forms of Protest</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Boycotts</strong> - Colonists refused to buy British goods</li>
                    <li><strong>Petitions</strong> - Sent letters asking Britain to repeal (cancel) the laws</li>
                    <li><strong>Violence</strong> - Some protests turned violent; tax collectors were threatened</li>
                    <li><strong>Homespun movement</strong> - Made their own cloth instead of buying British textiles</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="historical-note">
                    <h4>✅ Victory! Stamp Act Repealed</h4>
                    <p>Colonial protests worked! In 1766, Parliament repealed the Stamp Act. But they also passed the <strong>Declaratory Act</strong>, stating they had the right to tax the colonies "in all cases whatsoever." The conflict wasn't over.</p>

                <h2>☠️ Violence in Boston</h2>

                <h3>The Boston Massacre (1770)</h3>
                <p>Tensions were high in Boston where British soldiers (called "redcoats") were stationed to enforce laws.</p>

                        <p>A crowd of colonists surrounded British soldiers, throwing snowballs, ice, and insults. The nervous soldiers fired into the crowd, killing five colonists.</p>

                <div class="historical-note">
                    <h4>📰 Propaganda Power</h4>
                    <p>Samuel Adams and Paul Revere used the "massacre" as propaganda (information designed to influence opinion). Paul Revere created a famous engraving showing British soldiers firing on peaceful colonists. This wasn't exactly accurate, but it spread anti-British sentiment throughout the colonies.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>The Boston Tea Party (1773)</h3>
                <p>Parliament passed the <strong>Tea Act</strong>, giving the British East India Company a monopoly on tea sales in America. Colonists saw this as another attempt to control them.</p>

                <h2>😠 The Intolerable Acts (1774)</h2>

                <p>Britain was furious about the Boston Tea Party! Parliament passed harsh laws the colonists called the <strong>"Intolerable Acts"</strong> (also called Coercive Acts):</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Boston Port Act</strong> - Closed Boston Harbor until tea was paid for</li>
                    <li><strong>Massachusetts Government Act</strong> - Took away Massachusetts's self-government</li>
                    <li><strong>Administration of Justice Act</strong> - Allowed British officials accused of crimes to be tried in Britain (colonists called this the "Murder Act")</li>
                    <li><strong>Quartering Act</strong> - Required colonists to house British soldiers in their homes</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="historical-note">
                    <h4>⚠️ Britain's Mistake</h4>
                    <p>Britain hoped the harsh laws would isolate Massachusetts and scare other colonies into obedience. Instead, the colonies united in support of Massachusetts. "If they can do this to Boston, they can do it to us!"</p>

                    <li>Some delegates talked about independence, but most still hoped for compromise</li>

                <p>British General Thomas Gage learned that colonists were storing weapons in Concord, Massachusetts. He sent 700 soldiers to seize them.</p>
