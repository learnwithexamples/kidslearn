                <h1>Creating the Constitution</h1>
                <p>From the Articles of Confederation to the Constitution and Bill of Rights</p>
            </div>

            <section class="section">
                <h2>📜 The Articles of Confederation</h2>
                
                <p>After independence, the states needed a government. In 1781, they adopted the <strong>Articles of Confederation</strong> - America's first constitution.</p>

                <h3>Structure Under the Articles</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Weak central government</strong> - Most power remained with states</li>
                    <li><strong>One-house legislature</strong> (Congress) - Each state had one vote</li>
                    <li><strong>No executive branch</strong> - No president</li>
                    <li><strong>No judicial branch</strong> - No national court system</li>
                    <li><strong>No power to tax</strong> - Could only request money from states</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Problems with the Articles</h3>
                <div class="historical-note">
                    <h4>⚠️ Why the Articles Failed</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>No money:</strong> Congress couldn't pay debts or fund an army</li>
                        <li><strong>No trade regulation:</strong> States taxed each other's goods</li>
                        <li><strong>No enforcement:</strong> Congress couldn't force states to follow laws</li>
                        <li><strong>Hard to change:</strong> Needed all 13 states to agree on amendments</li>
                        <li><strong>No unity:</strong> States acted like 13 separate countries</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h3>Shays' Rebellion (1786-1787)</h3>
                <p>Massachusetts farmers, led by Daniel Shays, rebelled against high taxes and debt. The rebellion showed the Articles government was too weak to maintain order. This convinced leaders that a stronger government was needed.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="section">
                <h2>🏛️ The Constitutional Convention (1787)</h2>

                <p>In May 1787, delegates from 12 states met in Philadelphia to revise the Articles. Instead, they decided to write a completely new constitution.</p>

                <div class="key-figure">
                    <h4>Key Delegates</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>George Washington</strong> - President of the Convention</li>
                        <li><strong>James Madison</strong> - "Father of the Constitution," kept detailed notes</li>
                        <li><strong>Benjamin Franklin</strong> - Oldest delegate at 81, urged compromise</li>
                        <li><strong>Alexander Hamilton</strong> - Favored strong central government</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h3>Major Debates and Compromises</h3>

                <div class="timeline">
                    <div class="timeline-item">
                        <div class="timeline-date">The Virginia Plan</div>
                        <p>Proposed by James Madison. Called for representation based on population - favored large states.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="timeline-item">
                        <div class="timeline-date">The New Jersey Plan</div>
                        <p>Each state gets equal representation - favored small states.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="timeline-item">
                        <div class="timeline-date">The Great Compromise (Connecticut Compromise)</div>
                        <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Two-house legislature
                        <br>• House of Representatives - based on population
                        <br>• Senate - equal representation (2 senators per state)</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <h3>The Three-Fifths Compromise</h3>
                <p>Southern states wanted to count enslaved people for representation (more seats in Congress) but not for taxes. Northern states objected.</p>
                <p><strong>Compromise:</strong> Count enslaved people as 3/5 of a person for both representation and taxation. This was a tragic moral compromise that treated human beings as fractions.</p>

                <h3>The Slave Trade Compromise</h3>
                <p>Northern states wanted to ban the slave trade immediately. Southern states threatened to leave the Convention.</p>
                <p><strong>Compromise:</strong> Congress couldn't ban the slave trade until 1808 (20 years). This allowed slavery to continue and grow.</p>

                <h2>⚖️ Principles of the Constitution</h2>

                <h3>1. Popular Sovereignty</h3>
                <p>"We the People" - The government's power comes from the people.</p>

                <h3>2. Limited Government</h3>
                <p>Government can only do what the Constitution allows.</p>

                <h3>3. Separation of Powers</h3>
                <p>Power is divided among three branches:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Legislative Branch</strong> (Congress) - Makes laws</li>
                    <li><strong>Executive Branch</strong> (President) - Enforces laws</li>
                    <li><strong>Judicial Branch</strong> (Courts) - Interprets laws</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>4. Checks and Balances</h3>
                <p>Each branch can limit the power of the others:</p>
                <div class="historical-note">
                    <h4>Examples of Checks and Balances</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Congress</strong> can impeach and remove the president</li>
                        <li><strong>President</strong> can veto laws passed by Congress</li>
                        <li><strong>Supreme Court</strong> can declare laws unconstitutional</li>
                        <li><strong>Senate</strong> must approve treaties and presidential appointments</li>
                        <li><strong>Congress</strong> controls the budget</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h3>5. Federalism</h3>
                <p>Power is shared between the national government and state governments.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>National powers:</strong> Coin money, declare war, conduct foreign policy</li>
                    <li><strong>State powers:</strong> Run elections, establish schools, regulate in-state commerce</li>
                    <li><strong>Concurrent powers:</strong> Both can tax, build roads, establish courts</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>6. Judicial Review</h3>
                <p>Courts can determine if laws violate the Constitution (established later in Marbury v. Madison, 1803).</p>

                <h2>🤝 Federalists vs. Anti-Federalists</h2>

                <h3>Federalists (Supported the Constitution)</h3>
                <p><strong>Leaders:</strong> Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, John Jay</p>

                    <li>Supported by merchants, city dwellers, wealthy</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Anti-Federalists (Opposed the Constitution)</h3>

                    <h4>💬 Patrick Henry's Warning</h4>
                    <p>"I smell a rat!" - Patrick Henry refused to attend the Convention, fearing it would create too powerful a government. He later fought against ratification.</p>
