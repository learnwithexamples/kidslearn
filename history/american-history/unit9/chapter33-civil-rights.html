                <h2>⚖️ Background: Jim Crow America</h2>
                
                <p>After Reconstruction ended (1877), Southern states passed <strong>Jim Crow laws</strong> enforcing racial segregation:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Separate schools, restaurants, hotels, theaters</li>
                    <li>Separate drinking fountains, bathrooms, waiting rooms</li>
                    <li>African Americans forced to sit in back of buses</li>
                    <li>"Separate but equal" - but facilities for Black people were always inferior</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Plessy v. Ferguson (1896)</h3>
                <p>Supreme Court ruled that segregation was constitutional as long as facilities were "separate but equal." This decision legalized Jim Crow for nearly 60 years.</p>

                <div class="historical-note">
                    <h4>✊ Resistance Before the Movement</h4>
                    <p>African Americans never accepted segregation. Organizations like the NAACP (founded 1909) fought discrimination through courts, newspapers, and peaceful protest. But change was slow until the 1950s.</p>

                <h2>🏫 Brown v. Board of Education (1954)</h2>

                <p>The <strong>NAACP</strong> challenged school segregation. They represented Linda Brown, a Black girl forced to walk miles to a Black school when a white school was nearby.</p>

                <h3>The Decision</h3>
                <p>In a unanimous ruling, the Supreme Court declared:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>"Separate educational facilities are inherently unequal"</li>
                    <li>School segregation violated the 14th Amendment</li>
                    <li>Schools must desegregate "with all deliberate speed"</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Overturned Plessy v. Ferguson and sparked the modern Civil Rights Movement.</p>

                <h3>Little Rock Nine (1957)</h3>
                <p>Nine Black students tried to attend previously all-white Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas. Governor Orval Faubus used National Guard to block them.</p>
                <p>President Eisenhower sent federal troops to protect the students and enforce desegregation. This showed that the federal government would support civil rights.</p>

                <h2>🚌 Montgomery Bus Boycott (1955-1956)</h2>

                <h3>Rosa Parks Refuses to Give Up Her Seat</h3>
                <p>On December 1, 1955, Rosa Parks, a seamstress and NAACP member, refused to give up her bus seat to a white passenger in Montgomery, Alabama. She was arrested.</p>

                <p>This wasn't the first time someone had resisted bus segregation, but Parks was a respected community member, making her the perfect person to rally around.</p>

                <h3>The Boycott</h3>
                <p>Montgomery's Black community, led by 26-year-old minister <strong>Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.</strong>, organized a bus boycott:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>African Americans (70% of bus riders) refused to ride buses</li>
                    <li>Walked, carpooled, rode bicycles instead</li>
                    <li>Lasted 381 days</li>
                    <li>Bus company lost money, city lost revenue</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Victory</h3>
                <p>In November 1956, Supreme Court ruled that bus segregation was unconstitutional. Montgomery buses were desegregated. The boycott showed that:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Nonviolent protest could work</li>
                    <li>Economic pressure could force change</li>
                    <li>Black community could unite effectively</li>
                    <li>Dr. King was a powerful leader</li>

                <h2>✊ Nonviolent Resistance</h2>

                <h3>Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s Philosophy</h3>
                <p>King believed in <strong>nonviolent resistance</strong> inspired by Mahatma Gandhi's success in India:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Love your enemies:</strong> Respond to hate with love</li>
                    <li><strong>Accept suffering without retaliation:</strong> Don't fight back</li>
                    <li><strong>Attack injustice, not people:</strong> Fight the system, not individuals</li>
                    <li><strong>Moral persuasion:</strong> Win hearts and minds</li>
                    <li><strong>Redemptive suffering:</strong> Your suffering can change others</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="historical-note">
                    <h4>💬 King's Famous Quote</h4>
                    <p>"Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that."</p>

                <h3>Why Nonviolence?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Moral high ground:</strong> Showed who was right and who was wrong</li>
                    <li><strong>Media coverage:</strong> TV showed peaceful protesters being attacked</li>
                    <li><strong>Won support:</strong> White Americans sympathized with peaceful protesters</li>
                    <li><strong>Legal protection:</strong> Constitutional right to peaceful protest</li>

                <h2>🎓 Sit-Ins and Freedom Rides</h2>

                <h3>Greensboro Sit-Ins (1960)</h3>
                <p>Four Black college students sat at a "whites only" lunch counter at Woolworth's in Greensboro, North Carolina. They were refused service but stayed until closing time.</p>

                <p>The sit-in movement spread:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Thousands of students joined sit-ins across the South</li>
                    <li>Sat quietly at segregated lunch counters</li>
                    <li>Endured insults, violence, arrests</li>
                    <li>Many businesses desegregated to avoid losing money</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Freedom Rides (1961)</h3>
                <p>Integrated groups of activists rode buses through the South to test desegregation of interstate travel (which was supposed to be legal).</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Riders attacked by angry mobs in Alabama</li>
                    <li>Buses firebombed</li>
                    <li>Riders beaten severely</li>
                    <li>But they kept riding</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Result:</strong> Interstate Commerce Commission enforced desegregation of bus terminals.</p>

                <h2>📍 Birmingham Campaign (1963)</h2>

                <p>Birmingham, Alabama was one of the most segregated cities in America. Dr. King called it "the most thoroughly segregated city in the United States."</p>

                <h3>Project C (for Confrontation)</h3>
                <p>Civil rights activists organized protests:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Marches and sit-ins</li>
                    <li>Police Commissioner Eugene "Bull" Connor ordered violent response</li>
                    <li>Police attacked protesters with fire hoses and attack dogs</li>
                    <li>TV cameras captured the violence</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Children's Crusade</h3>
                <p>When adult protesters were jailed, thousands of children (some as young as 6) marched. Police arrested over 1,000 children.</p>

                <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Images of children being attacked shocked the nation and the world. President Kennedy proposed major civil rights legislation.</p>

                <h3>Letter from Birmingham Jail</h3>
                <p>While jailed, King wrote a powerful letter defending nonviolent resistance and criticizing white moderates who preferred "order" to justice.</p>
