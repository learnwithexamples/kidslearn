                <h2>⛵ The Age of Exploration</h2>
                
                <h3>Why Did Europeans Explore?</h3>
                <p>In the 1400s-1500s, European countries sent explorers across the oceans. They had several motivations, often called the <strong>"Three G's"</strong>:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Gold</strong> - Wealth from valuable resources and trade</li>
                    <li><strong>God</strong> - Spreading Christianity to new lands</li>
                    <li><strong>Glory</strong> - Fame and power for their countries</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="historical-note">
                    <h4>🧭 New Technology Made Exploration Possible</h4>
                    <p>Several inventions helped sailors travel farther:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Compass</strong> - showed direction</li>
                        <li><strong>Astrolabe</strong> - helped find latitude (north-south position)</li>
                        <li><strong>Caravel</strong> - fast sailing ship that could sail against the wind</li>
                        <li><strong>Better maps</strong> - more accurate charts of coasts and currents</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h3>The Search for Trade Routes</h3>
                <p>Europeans wanted spices, silk, and other goods from Asia. The land route was long and controlled by Middle Eastern traders. Europeans hoped to find a <strong>water route</strong> to Asia by sailing west across the Atlantic Ocean.</p>

                    <h4>Christopher Columbus (1451-1506)</h4>
                    <p><strong>From:</strong> Genoa, Italy</p>
                    <p><strong>Sailed for:</strong> Spain (King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella)</p>
                    <p>Columbus believed he could reach Asia by sailing west. He convinced Spain's monarchs to fund his voyage.</p>

                <div class="historical-note">
                    <h4>🤔 A Common Misconception</h4>
                    <p>Columbus did NOT discover America! Native Americans had lived there for thousands of years. Also, Vikings led by Leif Erikson had reached North America around 1000 CE, 500 years before Columbus.</p>
                    <p>Columbus never realized he had reached a continent unknown to Europeans. He died believing he had found a route to Asia!</p>
                </div>

                <h3>The Columbian Exchange</h3>
                <p>After Columbus's voyages, an exchange of people, plants, animals, and diseases began between Europe and the Americas. This is called the <strong>Columbian Exchange</strong>.</p>

                <p><strong>From the Americas to Europe:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Corn, potatoes, tomatoes, peppers, cacao, tobacco</li>
                    <li>Turkeys, llamas</li>
                    <li>Gold, silver</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>From Europe to the Americas:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Wheat, rice, sugar, coffee, bananas</li>
                    <li>Horses, cattle, pigs, sheep, chickens</li>
                    <li>Diseases (smallpox, measles, typhus) - these killed millions of Native Americans who had no immunity</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="historical-note">
                    <h4>⚠️ The Tragic Impact of Disease</h4>
                    <p>European diseases devastated Native American populations. Historians estimate that diseases killed 90% or more of Native Americans in some areas. This was the most catastrophic result of European contact.</p>

                <h3>Spanish Colonial System</h3>
