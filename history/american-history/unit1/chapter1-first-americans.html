                <h2>🌎 Migration to the Americas</h2>
                
                <h3>The Bering Land Bridge</h3>
                <p>Scientists believe that the first people came to the Americas during the last Ice Age, between 15,000 and 30,000 years ago. They crossed a land bridge called <strong>Beringia</strong> that connected Asia (Siberia) to North America (Alaska).</p>
                
                <div class="historical-note">
                    <h4>💡 Why was there a land bridge?</h4>
                    <p>During the Ice Age, so much water was frozen in glaciers that ocean levels dropped. This exposed land that is now underwater in the Bering Strait, creating a "bridge" between continents.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Following the Animals</h3>
                <p>These early people were <strong>hunter-gatherers</strong> who followed large animals like mammoths, mastodons, and giant bison. As they hunted, they gradually spread throughout North and South America over thousands of years.</p>

                <h2>🏕️ Native American Cultures</h2>
                
                <p>Over thousands of years, Native Americans developed diverse cultures adapted to their environments. Each region had its own unique way of life, traditions, and beliefs.</p>

                <h3>Arctic and Subarctic Peoples</h3>
                <p><strong>Inuit and Aleut</strong> peoples lived in the far north. They hunted seals, whales, and caribou, and built homes from snow (igloos) or animal skins. They adapted to one of Earth's harshest climates.</p>

                <h3>Northwest Coast</h3>
                <p>The <strong>Tlingit, Haida, and Chinook</strong> lived along the Pacific coast. The ocean and forests provided abundant food (salmon, shellfish). They were known for:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Totem poles - tall carved wooden poles telling family stories</li>
                    <li>Potlatch ceremonies - gift-giving feasts showing wealth and status</li>
                    <li>Skilled woodworking and canoe building</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Great Plains</h3>
                <p>The <strong>Sioux, Cheyenne, and Comanche</strong> were nomadic buffalo hunters. After horses arrived from Europe, Plains peoples became expert riders. They lived in portable homes called <strong>tepees</strong>.</p>

                <div class="historical-note">
                    <h4>🦬 The Importance of Buffalo</h4>
                    <p>Buffalo provided everything Plains peoples needed: meat for food, hides for clothing and shelter, bones for tools, and sinew for thread. Nothing was wasted!</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Eastern Woodlands</h3>
                <p>The <strong>Iroquois, Cherokee, and Powhatan</strong> lived in forests near rivers. They combined farming, hunting, and gathering. Key features:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Three Sisters</strong> - corn, beans, and squash grown together</li>
                    <li>Longhouses - large wooden homes for extended families</li>
                    <li>Iroquois Confederacy - alliance of five (later six) nations</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Southwest</h3>
                <p>The <strong>Pueblo, Hopi, and Apache</strong> peoples adapted to desert life. The Pueblo built amazing <strong>adobe</strong> cliff dwellings at places like Mesa Verde. They developed:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Irrigation systems for farming</li>
                    <li>Multi-story apartment-like buildings</li>
                    <li>Beautiful pottery and basket weaving</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Southeast</h3>
                <p>The <strong>Creek, Choctaw, and Seminole</strong> built large towns and had complex societies. They farmed rich soil along rivers and built earthen <strong>mounds</strong> for ceremonies and burials.</p>

                <h2>🎨 Native American Societies</h2>

                <h3>Government and Social Structure</h3>
                <p>Native American societies had organized governments, though they varied by culture:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Tribal councils</strong> - elders who made decisions for the group</li>
                    <li><strong>Chiefs</strong> - leaders chosen for wisdom, bravery, or skills</li>
                    <li><strong>Clans</strong> - family groups with special roles and responsibilities</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="key-figure">
                    <h4>The Iroquois Confederacy (Haudenosaunee)</h4>
                    <p>Around 1570, five Iroquois nations formed a confederacy (alliance) for peace and cooperation. They created a constitution called the <strong>Great Law of Peace</strong>. Some historians believe this influenced the U.S. Constitution centuries later!</p>
                    <p><strong>Member nations:</strong> Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga, Seneca (Tuscarora joined later)</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Religion and Beliefs</h3>
                <p>Most Native Americans believed that:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>All parts of nature have spirits and should be respected</li>
                    <li>Land cannot be owned - it belongs to everyone</li>
                    <li>Stories and oral traditions pass down history and values</li>
                    <li>Harmony with nature is essential for survival</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Trade Networks</h3>
                <p>Native American groups traded goods across vast distances:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Shells from the coast</li>
                    <li>Copper from the Great Lakes</li>
                    <li>Obsidian (volcanic glass) from the West</li>
                    <li>Food, furs, and handmade goods</li>
                </ul>
