                <h2>🗺️ The 13 Colonies</h2>
                
                <p>By the 1700s, England had established <strong>13 colonies</strong> along the Atlantic coast of North America. These colonies were divided into three regions, each with unique characteristics.</p>

                <h3>New England Colonies</h3>
                <p><strong>Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New Hampshire</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Climate:</strong> Cold winters, short growing season</li>

                    <p>Puritans valued education so everyone could read the Bible. Massachusetts passed the "Old Deluder Satan Act" (1647) requiring towns to establish schools. New England had the highest literacy rates in the colonies.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Middle Colonies</h3>

                </div>

                <h3>Southern Colonies</h3>
                <p><strong>Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia</strong></p>

                <h3>Development of Slavery</h3>
                <p>Slavery became central to the colonial economy, especially in the South:</p>

                <h3>Life Under Slavery</h3>
                <p>Enslaved Africans faced brutal conditions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Worked from sunrise to sunset, six days a week</li>
                    <li>Lived in small cabins with dirt floors</li>

                    <li>Had no legal rights - considered property</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>African American Resistance and Culture</h3>
                <p>Despite oppression, enslaved people maintained their humanity:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Preserved culture</strong> - music, stories, traditions from Africa</li>
                    <li><strong>Created community</strong> - strong family bonds despite separation</li>
                    <li><strong>Practiced religion</strong> - Christianity mixed with African traditions</li>
                    <li><strong>Resisted slavery</strong> - worked slowly, broke tools, ran away</li>
                    <li><strong>Rebellions</strong> - Some attempted armed resistance (though rare and brutally crushed)</li>
