                    <h4>🔍 Mystery of Roanoke</h4>
                    <p>To this day, no one knows what happened to the Roanoke colonists. They may have joined a nearby Native American tribe, been killed, or died from disease or starvation. Roanoke is known as the "Lost Colony."</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Jamestown - First Permanent English Colony (1607)</h3>
                <p>In 1607, the <strong>Virginia Company</strong> (a joint-stock company) established Jamestown in present-day Virginia.</p>

                <div class="key-figure">
                    <h4>Captain John Smith (1580-1631)</h4>
                    <p>Leader who helped Jamestown survive its early struggles. His famous motto: <em>"He who does not work, shall not eat."</em></p>
                    <p>According to legend, Pocahontas (daughter of Chief Powhatan) saved Smith's life, though historians debate if this really happened.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Jamestown's Struggles</h3>
                <p>The first years were extremely difficult:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Disease</strong> - Malaria and other illnesses from swampy land</li>
                    <li><strong>Starvation</strong> - Many colonists were gentlemen who didn't know how to farm or hunt</li>
                    <li><strong>Conflicts</strong> - Tensions with the Powhatan people</li>
                    <li><strong>"Starving Time" (1609-1610)</strong> - Only 60 of 500 colonists survived the winter</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="historical-note">
                    <h4>🌾 Tobacco Saves Jamestown</h4>
                    <p>In 1612, John Rolfe learned to grow tobacco from Caribbean seeds. Tobacco became extremely popular in Europe and saved the colony economically. The motto became: "Tobacco is our meat, drink, clothing, and money!"</p>
                </div>

                <h3>The First Representative Government</h3>
                <p>In 1619, Jamestown established the <strong>House of Burgesses</strong> - the first elected legislature in the American colonies. Male landowners could vote for representatives called "burgesses."</p>

                    <h4>⚫ 1619: The First Africans Arrive</h4>
                    <p>Also in 1619, the first Africans arrived in Virginia. At first, they were treated as indentured servants, but by the 1660s, Virginia had established slavery as a legal institution. This would have devastating consequences for centuries to come.</p>

                <h2>🦃 Plymouth and the Pilgrims (1620)</h2>

                <h3>Who Were the Pilgrims?</h3>
                <p>The <strong>Pilgrims</strong> were religious separatists who wanted to practice their faith freely, away from the Church of England. They are also called <strong>Separatists</strong>.</p>

                <div class="timeline">
                    <div class="timeline-item">
                        <div class="timeline-date">September 1620</div>

                        <p>41 men sign the <strong>Mayflower Compact</strong> - agreement to govern themselves</p>

                    </div>
                </div>

                <h3>The Mayflower Compact</h3>
                <p>Before landing, the Pilgrims created the <strong>Mayflower Compact</strong> - an agreement to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Form a government for the colony</li>
                    <li>Make and obey laws for the good of all</li>
                    <li>Work together for the colony's success</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This was an important step toward self-government in America.</p>

                <h3>Survival with Native American Help</h3>
                <p>Like Jamestown, Plymouth's first winter was devastating - about half the colonists died from cold, hunger, and disease.</p>

                <div class="key-figure">
                    <h4>Squanto (Tisquantum) (c. 1585-1622)</h4>
                    <p>A Wampanoag man who had learned English after being kidnapped by English traders. He returned to find his village destroyed by disease. Squanto taught the Pilgrims to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Plant corn using fish as fertilizer</li>
                        <li>Hunt and fish in the New World</li>
                        <li>Find safe sources of food and water</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Without Squanto's help, the Plymouth colony might not have survived.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="key-figure">
                    <h4>Massasoit (1581-1661)</h4>
                    <p>Chief of the Wampanoag people. He made a peace treaty with the Pilgrims that lasted more than 50 years. Both groups agreed to defend each other against enemies.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>The First Thanksgiving (1621)</h3>
                <p>In fall 1621, the Pilgrims celebrated their first successful harvest with a three-day feast. They invited Massasoit and about 90 Wampanoag people. This is considered the "First Thanksgiving," though it wasn't a holiday yet.</p>

                <div class="historical-note">

                        <li>Foods likely included: deer, wildfowl (duck/goose), fish, corn, squash, berries</li>
                        <li>No turkey or pumpkin pie (those came later!)</li>
                        <li>Thanksgiving wasn't made a national holiday until 1863 (President Lincoln)</li>

                <h3>The Puritans</h3>
                <p>The <strong>Puritans</strong> wanted to "purify" the Church of England (unlike the Pilgrims who wanted to separate). Led by <strong>John Winthrop</strong>, about 1,000 Puritans came to Massachusetts in 1630.</p>

                <h3>Puritan Society</h3>
                <ul>

                    <li><strong>Town meetings</strong> - Men gathered to discuss and vote on issues</li>
                    <li><strong>Education valued</strong> - Founded Harvard College (1636), first college in the colonies</li>
                    <li><strong>Strict rules</strong> - Laws regulated behavior, clothing, and religious practices</li>

                <div class="historical-note">
                    <h4>⚠️ Religious Intolerance</h4>
                    <p>Despite seeking religious freedom for themselves, Puritans did not tolerate other beliefs. People who disagreed were banished or punished. This led some to leave and found new colonies.</p>
