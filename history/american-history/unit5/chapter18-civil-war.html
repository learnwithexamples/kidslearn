                <h3>Fort Sumter (April 12, 1861)</h3>
                <p>The Civil War began when Confederate forces fired on Fort Sumter, a Union fort in Charleston Harbor, South Carolina. After 34 hours of bombardment, the Union surrendered the fort.</p>

                <p>This attack united the North. President Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers to put down the rebellion. In response, four more Southern states seceded: Virginia, Arkansas, Tennessee, and North Carolina.</p>

                <h2>📜 Emancipation Proclamation (January 1, 1863)</h2>

                <p>After the Union victory at Antietam, President Lincoln issued the <strong>Emancipation Proclamation</strong>. This executive order declared:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>All enslaved people in Confederate states were <strong>forever free</strong></li>
                    <li>Did NOT free enslaved people in border states (Kentucky, Maryland, Delaware, Missouri)</li>
                    <li>Did NOT free enslaved people in areas already under Union control</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Why Did Lincoln Issue It?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Military strategy:</strong> Weakened the Confederacy by freeing their labor force</li>
                    <li><strong>Moral purpose:</strong> Made the war about ending slavery, not just preserving the Union</li>
                    <li><strong>Foreign policy:</strong> Prevented Britain and France (who had abolished slavery) from supporting the Confederacy</li>
                    <li><strong>Military manpower:</strong> Allowed African Americans to enlist in Union army</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="historical-note">
                    <h4>✊ African Americans in the War</h4>
                    <p>After the Emancipation Proclamation, <strong>180,000 African Americans</strong> served in the Union army. They faced discrimination, received lower pay, and faced certain death if captured by Confederates. The famous <strong>54th Massachusetts Infantry</strong> proved their courage at Fort Wagner.</p>

                <h2>🎤 Gettysburg Address (November 19, 1863)</h2>

                <p>Four months after the Battle of Gettysburg, President Lincoln dedicated a cemetery there. His short speech (just 272 words, 2 minutes long) became one of the greatest speeches in American history.</p>

                <div class="historical-note">
                    <h4>📝 Key Lines from the Gettysburg Address</h4>
                    <p>"Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal."</p>
                    <p>"...that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom—and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth."</p>
                </div>

                <p>Lincoln redefined the war as a struggle not just to preserve the Union, but to bring equality and freedom to all.</p>

                <h2>⚔️ The War in the West</h2>

                <h3>Vicksburg Campaign (1863)</h3>
                <p>General Grant besieged Vicksburg, Mississippi, the last Confederate stronghold on the Mississippi River. After 47 days, the city surrendered on July 4, 1863 (same day as Gettysburg ended).</p>
                <p><strong>Result:</strong> Union controlled the entire Mississippi River, splitting the Confederacy in two.</p>

                <h3>Sherman's March to the Sea (1864)</h3>
                <p>General William Tecumseh Sherman captured Atlanta, then marched 300 miles to Savannah, Georgia. His army destroyed everything in a 60-mile-wide path:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Burned plantations, factories, railroads</li>
                    <li>Freed enslaved people</li>
                    <li>Practiced "total war" - destroying civilian resources to break Southern will</li>
